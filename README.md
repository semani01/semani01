## About Me

When I'm not doing academics, you can find me at a park or a yoga studio doing meditation. I also immerse myself in F1 and gaming. During interludes, I cycle, read, explore and hit the gym. I nerd hard for anything and everything Star Wars and Marvel, and have recently taken to [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18305490811140917/).
